# About Me üëãüèΩ
Welcome! I‚Äôm Victor, a cybersecurity student and aspiring SOC analyst building my skills one project at a time. After more than a decade in technical support, I‚Äôm shifting my focus toward cybersecurity‚Äîwhere I‚Äôm combining a strong troubleshooting background with hands-on experience in detection, analysis, and ethical hacking.

This GitHub is my space to document my learning journey and share hands-on projects as I transition into cybersecurity.
- Home Lab Projects ‚Äì Building and experimenting with Active Directory, SIEM (Splunk/Elastic), and endpoint logging.
-	CTF Writeups ‚Äì Walkthroughs from Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and other platforms to reinforce practical skills.
-	Red & Blue Team Exercises ‚Äì Exploring both attacker tactics (with tools like MITRE CALDERA, Metasploit, Nmap) and defender strategies (log analysis, detection, hardening).
-	Learning Portfolio ‚Äì Notes, guides, and reflections meant to show my progress while contributing to the security community.

I hope this becomes a resource not only for myself but also for other learners and security enthusiasts who are on the same path.
