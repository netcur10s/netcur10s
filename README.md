# About Me 👋🏽
Welcome! I’m Victor, a cybersecurity student and aspiring SOC analyst building my skills one project at a time. After more than a decade in technical support, I’m shifting my focus toward cybersecurity—where I’m combining a strong troubleshooting background with hands-on experience in detection, analysis, and ethical hacking.

This GitHub is my space to document my learning journey and share hands-on projects as I transition into cybersecurity.
- Home Lab Projects – Building and experimenting with Active Directory, SIEM (Splunk/Elastic), and endpoint logging.
-	Writeups – Walkthroughs from Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and other platforms to reinforce practical skills.
-	Red & Blue Team Exercises – Exploring both attacker tactics (with tools like MITRE CALDERA, Metasploit, Nmap) and defender strategies (log analysis, detection, hardening).
-	Learning Portfolio – Notes, guides, and reflections meant to show my progress while contributing to the security community.

I hope this becomes a resource not only for myself but also for other learners and security enthusiasts who are on the same path.

## 🎯 Current Focus
I’m actively building my skills and portfolio in areas most relevant to SOC and Blue Team roles:

- **Splunk & Log Analysis** → Forwarding Windows Security and Sysmon logs into Splunk, building dashboards to spot authentication patterns and anomalies.  
- **Active Directory Security** → Designing and hardening a small AD domain (1 DC + 2 endpoints), testing authentication flows and privilege escalation paths.  
- **Adversary Emulation** → Running MITRE CALDERA scenarios to simulate attacker techniques and see what shows up in the logs.  
- **Incident Response Practice** → Writing weekly lab notes and short reports to practice documenting detections and communicating findings.  
- **Hack The Box** → Progressing through the Jr. SOC Analyst path, creating structured writeups with both offensive steps and defensive takeaways.  

<!-- - Expanding Splunk detections with **Sigma rules → SPL queries**  
- Documenting adversary emulations with MITRE CALDERA  
- Strengthening SOC analyst workflows (alert triage, investigation, reporting) -->
